Description: Extends 'blockr.core' with interactive blocks for data
    visualization using 'ggplot2'. Users can build charts through a graphical
    interface without writing code directly. Includes common chart types
    (bar charts, line charts, pie charts, scatter plots) as well as statistical
    plots (boxplots, histograms, density plots, violin plots) with
    rich customization options and intuitive user interfaces.
